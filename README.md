# Browser

Tabula rasa.

This is a fresh start at a browser, with modern best practices, tooling and libraries.

Until there's more to see in the project, there won't be much in this README.

Current progress:

- `⇧⌘-N` New Project in Xcode
- Added Glean
- Added App Services Megazord
- Made directories to match the [Clean][clean-architecture] structure
- Configured Nimbus FML tooling to generated code.

Initial goals:

- An application menu, driven by Nimbus.
- A navigation structure, powered by deeplinks

This is a minimum before more than one person can parallel play together in the same repo without treading on other toes.

Follow ons:

- Settings page(s), driven by Nimbus.
- A view of History or Bookmarks from a signed in FxA account.

## Contributing

There is so little to see here, that we're not looking for contributions at this time.
